# CocoaScript

CocoaScript: Made by beginners, for beginners.

CocoaScript is a coding language made for beginners. It was created for one big reason: to create scripts fast and easily.

It is easy to learn, and has the essentials to coding, such as variables, functions, and etc, so that users can quickly learn how to use it,
and then switch to Python or Lua.

It is fully made in Python: you will need to install the latest version of Python in its official website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

The official GitHub page can be found here: [https://github.com/Kakaunet/CocoaScript](https://github.com/Kakaunet/CocoaScript).

## Warning

This coding language is made by a beginner in coding (with the help of AI, unfortunately), and will probably be glichy.

I do not like using AI, but, because some bugs and features i wanted to add were very hard to fix or implement, i was forced to use AI.

I am not responsible for any incidents, accidents, or any sort of negative or unexpected situation that may affect you, others, or your property,
such as but not limited to your computer or your laptop.
